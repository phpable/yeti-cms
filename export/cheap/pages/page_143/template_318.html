	to accept all cookies to be notified when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. If the last of

<p>

<p>
	<em><strong>Quality Assurance Policy</strong></em>
</p>

<p>
	You have an option to request a work sample of the writer
	who is working on your order. A work sample contains three random pages previously completed by the writer. All
	samples are automatically generated by the system, so we cannot guarantee that they will only contain text, and
	might contain in addition, graphs, charts, images, statistics, calculations, or references. A work sample can be
	used for quality assurance purposes only: it should not be copied or distributed.<br>
	After your order is assigned to	the writer, you have two hours to review the samples and to request another writer
	if the samples tendered do not meet your expectations. We can change the writer at your request no more than three
	times on one order.
</p>

<p>
	<em><strong>Use of samples for Quality Assurance Policy</strong></em>
</p>

<p>
	You will be asked to accept our Privacy
	Policy at a later stage. By accepting, you agree to allow us to use your order for quality assurance purposes. We
	only use a short abstract from your paper (not more than one page) to provide other clients with a work sample from
	their writer. The copy of the extract from your order is protected, so it cannot be copied or distributed.
