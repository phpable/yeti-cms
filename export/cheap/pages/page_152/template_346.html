<p>
	At <strong style="background-color: initial;">CheapCustomWriting.net</strong>, we take pride in providing high-quality
	academic assistance. We are always ready to revise your paper if it does not entirely meet your expectations. We
	will revise your paper free of charge if your revision request follows our main terms:
</p>

<p>
	INSTRUCTIONS: Your revision directions should <strong>remain the same</strong> 
	and not conflict with your initial instructions.
</p>

<p>
	SUBMISSION: You must submit your <strong>request for revision using the request revision</strong> button on your
	personal order page.
</p>

<p>
	DEADLINE: You can request a revision at any time before approving your order, but you
	have <strong>only 20 days after the order is initially approved</strong> to request a revision.
</p>

<p>
	If you require
	significant alterations to the original order, we will charge a rewriting fee that is calculated on the complexity
	of the task. Contact our operators for an estimate.
</p>

<p>
	If you request a revision 20 days after an order is
	approved, you will have to place a new order.
</p>

<p>
	Please note that we hold the rights to extend the deadline for
	revision as per the writer–¢s request in cases, when the time frame you have initially paid for allows such
	extension.
