	<strong>100% refund facility:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	In case you are not sure and decided to cancel your order before we hand
	it over to the writer, you will get a 100% refund. Moreover, if the task is already assigned to the writer the
	refund amount will depend on your stated deadline. You can make a claim of 70% refund if half or less than half of
	the given time has passed and after that the claim goes down to 50%. This is because the writer who has taken the
	work and started working should get some compensation for his/her work.<br>
	Please take a note that you wont be	getting a refund for an order cancellation if your work is
	completed and delivered on time. So, if the paper is submitted on time, you need to pay for it
	and you can claim a refund depending on quality issues.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Extra charges will be refunded:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	If you see that you have been charged twice, and you have 2 receipts
	from the system handling the payments that is PayPal or Authorize.net you can surely contact us. You can send us an
	email with both the receipts and the extra amount of payment will be refunded as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Check your orders while placing - Identical orders should get notified:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	If you witness that you have completed the payment for two similar orders by mistake,
	contact us at the earliest to clarify before it proceeds to
	the next level. It is your duty to cancel any orders that you don't want, before we assign it to our writers. If not
	notified, the orders will be treated as regular orders and standard refund procedures will apply.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Complete refund if the work is not done:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	We believe in total satisfaction of our clients and always try
	our best to assign the given work to the most appropriate writer. At times, the writer is not found and we
	completely refund, if it happens.<br>On the other hand, if you request for a revision of the paper which is done by
	another writer, and a suitable one is not available, our Dispute Resolution Specialist reviews your entire claim and
	then proceeds it accordingly towards a refund after you have formally requested it.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>No refund if the issue is from you side:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	If there is any sort of issue or lateness due to the late upload of
	materials from your side, you can apply for any sort of refund. So, you need to make sure to attach all the
	pertinent details and material while you are placing an order.<br>
	On the other hand, if due to some other reason the
	paper is delivered after the stated deadline, you can request for the refund according to the deadline for the
	delivery.<br>
	For example, if an 8 hour delivery paper is completed an hour after the deadline, it now falls into the
	24 hour delivery category and should cost less. So, the difference here in price is refunded. Moreover, if lateness
	occurs for long-term orders like 11-14 days, we can make a 7% refund.<br>
	If the first version of the paper is not
	approved by you, you can ask for a complete refund as you might not need the paper now.<br>
	All the lateness refund
	requests should be submitted immediately, within 14 days from the time the paper was actually delivered.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Separate refund rules for revisions:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	If we talk about revisions, the deadlines for revisions
	are defined separately so lateness refund and the complete recalculation process do not apply here.<br>When placing
	an order, you should choose the exact deadline in order to avoid any future confusion. Your final deadline for the
	submission should go in parallel with the date when your paper is due and should be more than 30% of your first
	draft deadline. It allows us to do any revisions, if required.<br>For your ease, when you select a deadline the
	system automatically frames a deadline and tells you the time of submission. If your submission deadline doesn't
	exceeds your first draft deadline by 30% you should go for some other time frames we usually offer.
